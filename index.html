<h2>PROJECTS</h2>
	<h3> ANALYSIS OF FAKE NEWS USING TWEETS </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Used the CREDBANK dataset to analyze how humans and
ClaimBuster system calculate credibility of tweets. </li>
		<li> Used the Twitter API to extract tweets and regular expressions for
tweet pre-processing in Python. Drew comparisons between those topics where humans and ClaimBuster system reacted differently.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>MUSIC RECOMMENDATION </h3>
	<ul>
		<li> Implemented Decision Tree and K-Means Clustering using sklearn in
Python on a subset of the million song dataset.</li>
		<li> Used to recommend songs in accordance with features such as genre,
length and year of release.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>FAIR CREDIT SCORE ALGORITHM </h3>
<ul> <li> Designed a New credit scoring algorithm in Python which factors a
second chance mechanism to generate a fair credit score. </li>
<li> It was created to help people from falling into a negative spiral of life.</li>
</ul>
<h3> REMOTE CODE REPOSITORY  </h3>
<ul> <li> Implemented a Repository Server with functionalities like check-in,
check-out, browse files, accessed using queries by clients in C++. </li>
<li> The communication system was constructed for passing HTTP style
messages and the GUI was build as a WPF application using C++/CLI.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARIZATION OF TEXT DOCUMENTS</h3>
<ul> <li> Created a Summary generator of text documents in Python which works
on the principles of phrase selection and merging. </li>
<li> A parsing tree was created in XML which holds all the Noun Phrases
(NPs) and Verb Phrases (VPs) of the input documents.</li>
<li> New Sentences were formed out of those NPs and VPs which are
compatible, replacable and above a threshold value. The summary which is generated is non redundant and coherent in nature</li>
</ul>
<h3> SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION </h3>
<ul> <li> Implemented the Page Rank Algorithm. </li>
<li> Analyzed how statuses of the websites are affected on the Internet and the changes that are needed to make a website appear on the top of the search results by analyzing the userâ€™s search history, location and reverse engineering.</li>
</ul>
<h3> WORDIFY </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Developed a software similar to Spelling Bee in Python Django Web Framework. </li>
	<li> Users listened how the words were pronounced and then they typed in the spelling of the words accordingly.</li>
	<li> This project significantly improved the spelling ability of users of the English language.</li>
